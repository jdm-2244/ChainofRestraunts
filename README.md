** For those who are grading our assignment **
Thank you for taking the time to look and assess our assignment, if you have any issues please contact us on discord!

First things first, we need to understand the prerequisite software that we are using to set up the assignment. We are using Node as a framework for our website.
** NOTE if you do not have node downloaded here is the link to download it: https://nodejs.org/ **
Using commands that come downloaded with node, double check to see if you have the dependencies downloaded within our folder/directory (we should already have them in the folder):
Copynpm install

Since we have a database dump here is the commands to import it: 
createdb Restaurant
psql Restaurant < Restaurant_V16.sql

Now look at our .env file. It should have a template like this:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/Restaurant
PORT=3000
Adjust the Username to your own username to your postresql on your personal machine. As well as the Password for your postresql.
Please note the port that is used.

We have inluded a .sql file named schema.sql (this does not include our full database but it creates the neccary tables needed for our transactions aswell as populating the database)
What you will need to do is create a server called Restaurant on postresql and then right click to select query tool to then copy from the sql file to then paste into the query to
then run it.

ðŸŽˆCongratulations you have created our databaseðŸŽˆ
Now we are hitting the home stretch type node index.js  into the terminal or command panel and you will activate our website on:
ðŸŒŸ http://localhost:3000 ðŸŒŸ
Once we have the website up and running, you'll see our homepage with several navigation options:

Users Profile Management - For managing customer accounts and memberships

Menu - Browse our menu items and their pricing

Place Order - Order food for pickup or delivery

Transactions - View order history and payment records

Dashboard - Access analytics and reports

Locations - View our restaurant franchise locations

While the interface is simple, it demonstrates core database functionality including customer management, order processing, and multi-location restaurant operations. Each section shows different ways we've implemented database queries and data management. ðŸ«¡

Again we are available if there are any issues regarding setting up or just questions with the website if not contacted originally from one of our teammates contact, ww2geek101 for any questions thank you!
